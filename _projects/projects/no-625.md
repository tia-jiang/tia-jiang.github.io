synopsis: "A young man drifts through the aftermath of a love that left him behind. Time refuses to behave — dates, conversations, even a doctor’s warning feel like signs pointing somewhere else. The story bends in loops: fragments of memory, surreal encounters, and absurd reminders of endings that arrive too soon. <br><br> It’s not a straight line, not meant to be. It’s an experiment in watching someone lose the clock inside his own head."
