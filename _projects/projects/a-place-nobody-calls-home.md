synopsis: Sometimes I carry a qipao into places that never asked for it. A church corner, a grocery store lot, the sidewalk outside Pep Boys. The 35mm black and white film turns them into stages, but the silence stays the same. I wonder if a home is made of walls, or if it’s made of how people look at you when you don’t belong.
